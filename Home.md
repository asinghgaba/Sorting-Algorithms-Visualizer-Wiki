### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as it's average and worst case complexity are of **ÎŸ(<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=x^2">)** where n is the number of items.
